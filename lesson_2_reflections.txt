What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git init
git status
You create a git repository which can track versions but no commits are made during initialization. The first commit has to be done with git commit. A system (unvisible) .git file is created.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's an intermediate place to put files before commiting. It shows what will be in the repository once we commit.

git add (add to the staging area)
git status
git commit -m ""
git diff (shows diff repository:staging area)
git diff --staged (diff staging area:last commit)
git diff commit1 commit 2
git checkout master (when HEAD detached)

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add changes one by one to the staging area and commit them separately.
